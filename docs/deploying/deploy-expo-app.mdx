# Deploy Your Expo App

This guide will walk you through setting up EAS (Expo Application Services) for deploying your Expo app to app stores and over-the-air updates.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [An Expo account](https://expo.dev/signup)
- [iOS Developer account](https://developer.apple.com/account/) (for App Store deployment)
- [Google Play Console account](https://play.google.com/console) (for Google Play Store deployment)

## 1. Login to Expo

Authenticate with your Expo account using the yarn command:

```bash
yarn eas:login
```

This command will:

- Install EAS CLI if not already installed
- Authenticate with your Expo account
- Securely store your credentials for future use

## 2. Initialize EAS in Your Project

Set up EAS for your project:

```bash
yarn eas:init
```

This command will:

- Create a new project on your Expo account if one does not already exist, and link it
- If the project already exists, link it to your Expo account

> You can see your project ID in your `app.json` file at `extra.eas.projectId`

## 3. Configure EAS Build

Configure your build settings and credentials:

```bash
yarn build:configure
```

This command will:

- Create an `eas.json` configuration file
- Set up build profiles (development, preview, production)
- Configure distribution settings for each platform

## 4. Build Your App

Now you can build your app for different platforms and environments:

> **Note:** if you wish to run your app in a physical device, your device must be connected to the same WIFI

### Android Builds

#### Development Build

```bash
yarn build:android:dev
```

This command will:

- Create a development build for Android
- Include debugging tools and development features like **Hot reloading**
- Generate an APK for internal testing
- Use development signing certificates

#### Preview Build

```bash
yarn build:android:preview
```

This command will:

- Create a preview build for internal testing and QA
- Generate an APK for easy sharing with testers
- Use preview signing certificates
- Optimize for testing without development overhead
- Include production-like performance characteristics

#### Production Build

```bash
yarn build:android:prod
```

This command will:

- Create a production-ready build for Google Play Store
- Generate an AAB (Android App Bundle) file
- Use production signing certificates
- Optimize for performance and size
- Remove all debugging tools and development features

### iOS Builds

#### Development Build

```bash
yarn build:ios:dev
```

This command will:

- Create a development build for iOS
- Include debugging tools and development features like **Hot reloading**
- Generate an IPA for internal testing
- Use development provisioning profiles

#### Preview Build

```bash
yarn build:ios:preview
```

This command will:

- Create a preview build for TestFlight and internal testing
- Generate an IPA ready for TestFlight upload
- Use preview provisioning profiles
- Optimize for testing without development overhead
- Include production-like performance characteristics

#### Production Build

```bash
yarn build:ios:prod
```

This command will:

- Create a production-ready build for App Store
- Generate an IPA file for App Store submission
- Use production provisioning profiles and certificates
- Optimize for performance and size
- Remove all debugging tools and development features

## 5. Submit to App Stores

After building your app, you can submit it to the respective app stores:

### Submit to Google Play Store

```bash
yarn submit:android
```

This command will:

- Upload your production AAB file to Google Play Console
- Submit the app for review (if configured)
- Use your configured Google Play service account credentials
- Automate the submission process to Google Play Console

### Submit to Apple App Store

```bash
yarn submit:ios
```

This command will:

- Upload your production IPA file to App Store Connect
- Submit the app for review (if configured)
- Use your configured Apple Developer credentials
- Automate the submission process to App Store Connect

## Quick Reference

### Complete Workflow

Here's the complete yarn command workflow for EAS deployment:

```bash
# 1. Login to Expo
yarn eas:login

# 2. Initialize EAS in your project
yarn eas:init

# 3. Configure build settings and credentials
yarn build:configure

# 4. Build for Android
yarn build:android:dev      # Development build
yarn build:android:preview  # Preview build
yarn build:android:prod     # Production build

# 5. Build for iOS
yarn build:ios:dev          # Development build
yarn build:ios:preview      # Preview build
yarn build:ios:prod         # Production build

# 6. Submit to app stores
yarn submit:android         # Submit to Google Play Store
yarn submit:ios             # Submit to Apple App Store
```
