## ETH Mobile Tech Stack

ETH Mobile is not a product itself but more of a combination or stack of other great tools. It allows you to quickly build and iterate over your smart contracts and frontends.

Here are the main components:

- [**Hardhat**](https://hardhat.org/docs) for running local networks, deploying and testing smart contracts.
- [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev/docs) for building a frontend, using many useful pre-made hooks.
- [**Ethers.js**](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) for generating wallets and interacting with Ethereum.
- [**React Native Paper**](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/) for pre-built components.
