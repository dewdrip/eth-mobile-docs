[ETH Mobile](https://github.com/dewdrip/eth-mobile) is an open-source toolkit for building decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains. It simplifies mobile dApp development with fast, secure and customizable pre-built components to create, deploy and interact with smart contracts.

⚙️ **Tech Stack**: Built with React Native, Hardhat, Ethers, and TypeScript to streamline mobile dApp development.

### Key Features

- 🧑‍💻 **Contract Debugger**: Inspect smart contract details such as address, balance, variables, and functions. It also allows real-time interaction with contracts, making development more efficient.
